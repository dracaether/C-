# C++
// this is a repository of all my modified source codes written in C++ (TurboC++).

----
## NOTE:
The source codes uploaded here are **MODIFIED** - meaning, if you just randomly copied and ran the program, it **will NOT RUN**.
To make the program work, you have to skim through the code aka you fix it ;)

Once you do fix it, however, consider the code yours.

These codes are under the IDGAF Licence. **tl;dr**, do whatever you want at your own leisure. Full license is in this repository under
*IDGAF_License.txt*. Fair warning that I do not own the text file nor written it.

Also, these codes are written in **C++** and was tested on **Turbo C++**. I am fully aware that this piece of software is [outdated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B) and should be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), however Turbo C++ is a requirement of my IT Fundamental class and will continue to use this software until further notice.

### Notice:
This repository is made to help aspiring programmers and guide them to make their programs work. I am no professional programmer nor instructor, I am just a person who likes to help anyone I can.
