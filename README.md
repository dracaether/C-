### FAQ:

  Q.  I see an error on your code!

  A. If you're referring to simple syntax errors, I did that on **purpose**. Read [Note](https://github.com/dracaether/C-#note).
  If you're referring to complex errors, [issue](https://github.com/dracaether/C-/issues/new) an error (if you have an account), or pm me via [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dracaether).
  
----
  Q. I want to contribute/help!
  
  A. You can do that by [pulling a request](https://github.com/dracaether/C-/compare) or fork (by clicking 'fork' on the top right of the page) this repo into your account and modify what needs to be modified. While you can contribute/help via FB, it's easier to manage if you have a GitHub account. Click [here](https://github.com) to start making one.
 
----
  Q. How long does it take you to upload?
  
  A. Since these are just codes, it takes no time at all! However, I am human and sometimes I have life to tend to, so any updates to old codes, corrections, additions and especially taking down codes may sometimes get delayed.

----
  Q. Can I share this link to anyone?
  
  A. Hey, as long as you believe that this repo can help them, why not?
  
----
  Q. How did you come up with this?
  
  A. The repo? People nowadays are asking me how to write a program and while I love to help, going around group chats and pms tends to be tedious for me, and sometimes when I'm out and about I don't always bring my laptop/phone/flashdrive with me. This exists to help them, even when I'm not around.
  
----
  Q. No, really, how did you come up with this [insert code here]?
  
  A. Have questions about the code? Pm me!


**If you have any more questions, better issue or pm me.**

### NOTE:
The source codes uploaded here are **MODIFIED** - meaning, if you just randomly copied and ran the program, it **will NOT RUN**.
To make the program work, you have to skim through the code aka you fix it ;)

Once you do fix it, however, consider the code yours.

These codes are under the IDGAF Licence. **tl;dr**, do whatever you want at your own leisure. Full license is in this repository under
*IDGAF_License.txt*. Fair warning that I do not own the text file nor written it.

Also, these codes are written in **C++** and was tested on **Turbo C++**. I am fully aware that this piece of software is [outdated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B) and should be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), however Turbo C++ is a requirement of my IT Fundamental class and will continue to use this software until further notice.

### Notice:
This repository is made to help aspiring programmers and guide them to make their programs work. I am no professional programmer nor instructor, I am just a person who likes to help anyone I can.
